# CTC24
This is the home repository for [CTC24: Open in Practice](https://codethecity.org/what-we-do/hack-weekends/ctc24-open-in-practice/), which ran Saturday 27th November 2021 and Sunday 28th November 2021. The Miro board of ideas and work captured concepts well [CTC24 Miro Board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lhmdaeQ=/).

On Saturday we had 11 participants working on 3 challenges. On Sunday we had 11 participants working on the same 3 challenges. Participants were from Scotland, England and the Netherlands.

We used our main Zoom session to hold the space and alternated between main room where everyone should be together, and breakout rooms for group work in 90 minutes blocks of time. We then came back together to check in on how teams were getting on, and to share information and offers of help.

We used Slack and our Code the City workgroup as the back channel between rooms, and to coordinate the event outside of Zoom. This worked well in the run-up to the event, and also as the jumping off point for each day.

## The Projects were
We had three teams working on a range of topics. All of them were continuations of previous projects.

### The Open Data Catalogue of Scottish Local Authorities
[The OD Bods](https://github.com/CodeTheCity/the_od_bods) was started at CTC23 and picked up further at SODU2021, and continues now as an opportunity for the team to work together. You can see their progress at https://opendatascotland.github.io/the_od_bods/ which feeds the website at https://opendata.scot

### The Waste Wizards
[Waste Wizards](https://github.com/CodeTheCity/ctc21_waste_wizards) was started at CTC21, and has continued regularly since then.

### Scottish Representation in Wikidata
[Government agencies in Scotland](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Govdirectory/United_Kingdom#Agencies_in_Scotland_%28Q22%29) as part of the [GovDirectory](https://github.com/govdirectory) project is being worked on by a few people this weekend.
